This Python simulation calculates the energy of a solid interacting with the Lennard Jones Potential. 
The crystal structire of the solid is taken as FCC and the FCC lattice is generated based on the given dimensions.
A simulation cell is created and interactions only within the boundaries of the simulation cell have been considered.
The Potential energy vs distance curve has been plotted for a set of values of lattice parameters and corresponding cutoff radius of the simulation cell.
Consequenctly, the lowest potential energy, equilibrium distance and equilibrium lattice parameter has been calculated for each value of lattice parameter. 
The plot for the maximum potential energy vs lattice parameter shows how the attractive and repulsive forces behave on changing the lattice parameter.
The simulation also deals with the cases when lattice parameter becomes too large or too small.
